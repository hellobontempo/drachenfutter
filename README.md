# README

This app is currently in development. 

# Welcome to Drachenfutter.
The main purpose of this application is so users can search for recipes with what they already have on hand and network with those who have similar appetites and taste!

## Getting Started
Run `bundle install` to get all of the necessary gems. To maximize the functionality of this web application, the seed file utilizes an API that generates a random recipe. I recommend seeding the database with at least 100 recipes so the user has content to browse and review.  Once the seeds.rb file is to your liking, run `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` to create and seed the database. Have fun!
